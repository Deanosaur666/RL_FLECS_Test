How do we get them to not be stuck in walls, while also letting them jump when going downhill?


PLANS

There are four types of soldiers, and four types of coins, and four types of lasers, and four types of blood.

Soldiers attack soldiers of other types. Soldiers want coins of the same type.
Coins heal soldiers and increase their firepower.

Cats are non hostile and wander around.

If a single soldier gets enough coins, he becomes a pursuer.
Pursuers want to kill all soldiers.

Soldiers run from pursuers if within short range, but otherwise shoot at them.

The planet has some hills, and blocks and brick walls which block shots and vision.

The player can take control of any creature.
When controlling a creature, they left click to move and right click to attack.

Cats and pursuers do a melee attack. They turn red and dash, hurting anyone who touches them.
This has a cooldown.

All attacks send creatures flying a short distance.
Pursuers have large attack radius and knockback.
